          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
          <p>
            I am a skilled programmer with a strong aptitude for complex problem-solving. With my subject matter expertise and collaboration skills, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality code and effectively supporting team needs.            
            During my academic journey, I have actively participated in various extracurricular activities that have helped me develop into a well-rounded individual. As a representative of the Placement Cell, I gained valuable experience in networking and communication, which helped me understand the job market and build connections.
            
            I also served as a member of the National Service Scheme (NSS), where I had the opportunity to contribute to social causes and give back to the community. Being elected as the Technical Head of the Counselling Committee further honed my leadership skills, and I organized and managed a successful event called "Darpan."
            
            In addition, I volunteered at departmental fests "Cloud 2.0" and "Cloud 3.0," which gave me exposure to diverse skillsets and team dynamics. I also have experience planning, coordinating, and advertising special events, including annual career fairs, job fairs, and education fairs.
            
            In summary, I am a skilled programmer with a diverse skill set and experience in various extracurricular activities. I am eager to take on new challenges and grow both professionally and personally. Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Product Landing Page (Recycling)</h2>
            <p>One of the key features of the website is its user interface, which is simple and intuitive. I have designed the website with a minimalistic approach, focusing on the content and ensuring ease of navigation. The website's layout is designed to ensure that users can find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
              Another notable feature of the website is its use of animations and transitions. I have used CSS animations and transitions to add visual interest and enhance the user experience. The website's animations are designed to be subtle and not distracting, and they serve to provide feedback to the user.</p>
